# Snesh and Fallen's little fourre-tout 

## This is our mess and shouldn't be public tbh 

<br> 

Used to be implemented as ARC Boosts. 

Version 2.0. added - and tbh replaced by - support for stylus and userscripts to be used in other browsers/other OS. 

- Todoist (deprecated - now has its own repo) 
- ChatGPT (deprecated - now has its own repo) 
- Reddit - Will never be deprecated because implementing shit in new Reddit in anything else but Arc is ass. Maybe when we do be redoing arc in zen, we'll revisit :COPIUM:
- YouTube - Slightly better youtube, mostly a bit of transparency and box shadows here and there.
- Google - Will probably be deprecated when usable.
